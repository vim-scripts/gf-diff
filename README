*gf-diff* is a Vim plugin to extend |gf| and other commands.  With this
plugin, you can open the file and locate the cursor to a comfortable position
from the hunk of a diff output under the cursor.  It is useful whenever you
review patches and uncommitted changes in Vim.

Suppose that the current buffer contains the following text (here the most
left numbers are line numbers):

	 1 diff --git a/autoload/gf/diff.vim b/autoload/gf/diff.vim
	 2 index 469fdb3..b135316 100644

	21    return d
	22  endfunction

If you type |gf| on the 12th line and there is no file whose name is under the
cursor, "autoload/gf/diff.vim" will be opened and the cursor will be moved to
the 25th line of the file.  Because the hunk under the cursor represents the
file and the position.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.3 or later
- |gf-user| 0.0.0 or later
